# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started planning my practicals on paper before coding, which helps me clarify my approach and catch potential 
errors early. This change has reduced debugging time and improved my understanding of the problem requirements.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to allocate more consistent time for reviewing lecture materials before starting practicals. Sometimes, I rush 
into coding without fully grasping concepts like classes, which slows me down. A more disciplined study schedule would 
really help me.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistently completing practicals on time and engaging with the code review process, which has improved my coding 
style and attention to detail. I will continue seeking and providing feedback to learn from my peers.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on starting the extension tasks. While I complete the required work, I often skip the 
optional exercises due to time constraints, which limits my deeper learning. I plan to prioritize at least one extension 
task per practical.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I suggest incorporating more interactive tutorials or live coding sessions in the subject to reinforce complex topics 
like object-oriented programming. This would help bridge the gap between theory and practical application for students 
like me.
