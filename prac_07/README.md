# CP1404 Practicals

## About the Repository
This repository contains my practical exercises for the CP1404 Programming II subject at James Cook University. The 
exercises focus on applying Python programming concepts, including classes, file handling, and clean code principles, 
to build practical applications.

## About Me
I’m Fabian Uchendu, a first-year IT student at JCU. I’m learning Python to develop skills in software development and 
problem-solving. This repository showcases my progress in the subject.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Functions and classes should have one clear purpose, making code easier to maintain and test.
- **Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Reusing code through functions and modules reduces redundancy and improves readability.
- **Meaningful Naming**: Using descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes makes code self-documenting and easier to understand.
