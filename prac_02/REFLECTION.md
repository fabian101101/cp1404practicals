70%

What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I schedule 1-hour sessions on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at 7 PM in my home study area.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I’m completing all practical tasks on time and practicing Git commits, which helps me stay organized and build my skills.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop procrastinating on watching lecture videos and start reviewing them earlier in the week to better understand concepts.

What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I sometimes rush my code without testing thoroughly, so I’ll change by testing edge cases, like empty inputs, more carefully.

What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I’m writing clear functions and following the SRP, like in score_menu.py, which makes my code easier to understand and reuse.
